# hierarchysort
A bottom-up, iterative Mergesort-like implementation that runs in Ω(n) and O(n×log_2(n)) and approximately O(1.75n) to O(8n) and Ω(1) auxiliary space.

Good implementations are likely very cache-friendly / cache-coherent, and paired with a pre-processing step on the data stream it might have very good real-world performance.
